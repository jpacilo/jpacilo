## Hi, I'm Paolo 👋

I'm a data scientist and a software engineer working in the intersection of climate action + AI. Currently, I'm exploring:
- How we can identify green equity gaps in the built environment using computer vision, statistics, and AI
- How we can leverage agentic AI systems to accelerate energy system modelling (discovery + optimization)

Outside development work, I play 🎾, shoot 📸, and drink ☕️

I'm best reached via email for anything interesting!
