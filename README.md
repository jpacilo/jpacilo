## Hi, I'm Paolo 👋

I am an average data scientist and software engineer with above average hunger and passion in solving the big hairy problems of today. I am based in 🇸🇬 where it's mostly 🌤️ or 🌧️. Outside work, I play sports 🎾 and take [pictures](https://vsco.co/jpacilo/gallery) 📸 in my free time. I am best reached via [email](joshuaacilo.13@gmail.com) for anything interesting.
