## Hi, I'm Paolo 👋

I'm a software engineer and data scientist currently working in the intersection of climate, energy, sustainability, and AI. I'm based in 🇸🇬 where it's mostly 🌤️ or 🌧️. Outside work, I play 🎾 and take 📸 in my free time. I am best reached via [email](joshuaacilo.13@gmail.com) for anything interesting.
