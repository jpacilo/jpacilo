## Hi, I'm Paolo 👋

I'm a software engineer (thinks in systems) and a data scientist (thinks in patterns) working in the intersection of climate, energy, sustainability + AI. I'm currently based in sunny 🇸🇬. I aspire to build the next gen of solutions that moves the needle in fixing our climate problem.

> Outside work, I play 🎾, shoot 📸, drink ☕️, and travel 🌏.
